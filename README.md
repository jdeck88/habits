Collecting Data

Have at least one habit called "Take Blood Pressure" in your habit tracker.  In this habit there is a memo field you fill out with your blood pressure and you fill out like "120/80".  Optionally, you can make a note separated with a comma -- "120/80, used new cuff".  Record all of your other habits you want.
